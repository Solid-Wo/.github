## 🧠 Overview

**SolidWorks** is a powerful 3D CAD application widely used in mechanical engineering, product design, and industrial development. It provides a complete environment for creating precise parts, complex assemblies, and detailed technical documentation within a unified workflow.

The software is built around parametric modeling, allowing engineers and designers to define dimensions, constraints, and relationships that update automatically when changes are made. This approach improves accuracy, speeds up iterations, and reduces design errors throughout the development process.

SolidWorks supports the entire product lifecycle — from concept and prototyping to manufacturing-ready models. Its intuitive interface makes complex engineering tools accessible, while advanced features support simulation, analysis, and validation of real-world behavior.

Optimized for Windows workstations, SolidWorks delivers reliable performance when working with large assemblies and detailed components. It is an industry-standard solution trusted by professionals for precise, efficient, and scalable 3D design.
